### Kijun Arrow ###
This indicator paints an arrow below or above the candlestick when Kijun-sen changes to a new direction.
### Quantity Quality Commitment (QQC) ###
The QQC aims to gauge the underlying strength of momentum by looking at 3 metrics: quantity, quality and commitment.
* **Quantity**: a tally of bullish versus bearish candlesticks for defined periods.
* **Quality**: the quality of bullishness versus bearishness in the candlesticks for defined periods, e.g. if a bullish candlestick has little wicks, it signifies the bulls are in control from beginning to end, hence get a high score for the bull's tally.
* **Commitment**: the prior two metrics can send out a false sense of direction if thereâ€™s little volume, as lack of volume builds an unsteady momentum, therefore, this element takes the volume into the equation to paint a final picture from 3 aspects.
* **ADX**: if ADX is above 20, it's deemed to be in a trendy environment, otherwise it's not trendy and the price action would likely be choppy; this indicator is shown in histogram format.
